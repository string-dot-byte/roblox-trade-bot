# Roblox Trade Bot

This is just a practice for me to get more familiar with python.

This basically requires you to input the items you want to trade, and which item you want in return. It doesn't go look for trades for you, you must know what you want to give and receive.

**CLEAR THE WHITELIST/BLACKLIST EVERY 5 DAYS** (preferably 3, but can be more just not too far or else you may experience less trades being sent)
