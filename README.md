# Roblox Trade Bot

This is just a practice for me to get more familiar with python.

This basically requires you to input the items you want to trade, and which item you want in return. It doesn't go look for trades for you, you must know what you want to give and receive.

Insert your proxies in the `proxies` list. Do not forget to insert your cookie and your UserId in the code.
Your item's UAID can easily be found on your Rolimons profile when looking at your items. The item's ID is the number seen in the item's url page.

**CLEAR THE WHITELIST/BLACKLIST EVERY 5 DAYS** (preferably 3, but can be more just not too far or else you may experience less trades being sent)

Essential modules required are in the `requirements.txt` file. Note that you may need to install other modules if you're not on Python 3.9.

Please be careful while using this bot, do not send unfair trades nor spam people.
